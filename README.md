My first front-end coding challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - *Newbie Level*..


## 1.Huddle landing page

## 2.Intro component with sign-up form
#### Branch Name/`Sign-up form`: **completed on July 8, 2022**.
The goal is to build out an intro component and a form with validation.  

#### Challenges

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
